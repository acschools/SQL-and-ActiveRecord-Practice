/* Create a view for the 100 smallest (area) countries in the world
Call it small_area
Create a view for the 100 smallest (population) countries in the world
Call it small_population
Determine which countries are in both lists
Determine which countries are in neither list
Which is the small country with the biggest
gnp?
Give answers for “small” by area and
population
What is the sum of surface area of
the 10 biggest countries in the world?
The 10 smallest?
Use SELECT DISTINCT and your best judgement to
create a table with the governmentforms that are
  undemocratic. How can we (mostly) avoid typing them
  out (hint: the IDs are easier to type)?
  How can we now easily create a view of the
  governmentform values that are democratic (assume
    that is the same as NOT undemocratic)What are the minimum and maximum GNP/
    capita of democratic and undemocratic
    countries?
    Hint: use IN
How many of the smallest
countries are undemocratic?
How about the biggest?
Which languages are
spoken in the ten largest
(area) democratic countries?
Are there any languages
spoken only in democratic
or undermocratic countries?
What is the total city
population in countries that
speak English? Spanish?
Are there any countries
without an official
language?
Are there any countries
without an official
language?
How many countries
have no cities?
Which countries have the
100 biggest cities in the
world?
What languages are spoken
in the countries with the 100
biggest cities in the world?
Which countries have the highest
proportion of official language speakers?
The lowest?
